- 👋 Hi, I’m @ianisout
- 👀 I’m interested in humor. Also learning and applying my knowledge while studying to be a fullstack developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pretty much everything. From HTML/CSS to advancing in JavaScript, git, and everything else that's involved in a fullstack curriculum
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on funny projects
- 📫 How to reach me: look around for ianisout, that's all. (Or ian-lima if you're on LinkedIn)
